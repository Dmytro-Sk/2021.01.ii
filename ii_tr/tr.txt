We need some help collecting information on competitor pricing across a number of products.

We need help:

1 - Collect name, pricing and quantity information from product listings from each website.
2 - Each website only needs one price for each kind of tea.
3 - Select the most inexpensive price from each category.
4 - Loose leaf tea's should use grams for their quantity unit.
5 - Tea bags / tea sachets should use tea bags for their quantity unit.
6 - If the product has different quantities use the smallest quantity available.

Includes 16 websites and 6 products per website.
